# python
Learning Python. Uploading some basic projects I am doing while learning Python. 

This is my first python code I have made after learning Python just for 3 days. I think Python is easy to learn.
This program will take user input in the terminal and check if the age is either 20 or more than that. If the age is True, it will print some lines otherwise, it will say you can't use our app. I will add some more features once I learn the advanced topics of Python. 
Consider reviewing and making changes if you want.
Thanks
